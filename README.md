# fireFoam-dev
FireFOAM is a CFD code for modeling fire suppression based on the OpenFOAM-dev version of OpenFOAM (R) http://www.openfoam.org. OpenFOAM (R) is a general purpose open source CFD toolbox written in C++. It utilizes the finite volume method on arbitrarily unstructured meshes, and is highly scalable on massively parallel computers. For more information about OpenFOAM, please refer to http://www.openfoam.org.  For more information about FireFOAM and research related to fire modeling at FM Global, please see the FM Global Fire Modeling website (http://www.fmglobal.com/modeling) and the Open CFD fire modeling website.
